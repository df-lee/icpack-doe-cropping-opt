### Preprocessing Stage

#### 1. Object Definition

In the preprocessing stage, a set of candidate process parameters was selected based on engineering experience, with the aim of evaluating their effects on burr formation during the cropping process, as illustrated in the table below.

### Optimization Stage

#### 1. Fractional Factorial Design

To efficiently screen non-influential variables, a ***Resolution IV Fractional Factorial Design*** was conducted. In the context of factorial design, resolution of a design is defined as *the length of the shortest word in its defining relation.* A higher resolution indicates less aliasing (i.e., overlap) between effects. Specifically, Resolution III designs confound main effects with two-factor interactions, Resolution IV designs keep main effects unaliased with any two-factor interactions (though two-factor interactions may be aliased with each other), etc. Resolution IV was selected because it offers a practical balance between experimental efficiency and interpretability: it enables confident estimation of main effects‚Äîwhich are the primary focus during initial screening‚Äîwhile significantly reducing the number of required experimental runs compared to higher resolution settings. This makes it well suited for identifying key process drivers without the overhead of modeling higher-order interactions.

After collecting response data, the ***Half-Normal Plot of Effects*** was used to detect factors whose standardized effects deviate from the distribution expected under the null hypothesis. Significance was determined using *Lenth‚Äôs Pseudo Standard Error (PSE)*, with a threshold corresponding to a 0.05 significance level. To prioritize experimental resources, the ***Pareto Plot of Effects*** was used to rank all statistically significant factors by their absolute effect sizes. If the number of significant factors exceeded four, only the top four based on scaled effect magnitude were retained for subsequent full factorial optimization. This constraint ensures that the total number of experimental runs remains manageable while preserving the most influential contributors to the response.

#### Variable Mapping

Four key factors ‚Äî blade speed, cutting force, blade material, and tape adhesion type ‚Äî were identified as primary contributors based on their mechanical influence on cutting quality. A **Mixed-Level Central Composite Design (CCD)** was constructed based on four selected control factors. CCD enables the construction of a second-order response surface model by combining three distinct categories of design points. Each quantitative variable was mapped to three levels:

---

- **Cutting Force** (N):   20 (‚àí1),   25 (0),   30 (+1)
- **Blade Speed** (rpm): 3000 (‚àí1), 4000 (0), 5000 (+1)

---

#### CCD Design Points

First, ***center points*** represent the midpoint of the experimental region. In this design, five center replicates were used to ensure statistical stability. Second, ***factorial points*** correspond to the full factorial combinations of high (+1) and low (‚àí1) levels for each continuous factor. With two quantitative variables, this results in four factorial runs. Third, ***axial points*** are positioned outside the factorial space at ¬±Œ± along each factor axis. Rotatability is a property of response surface designs that ensures the prediction variance remains constant at all points equidistant from the design center. In this study, the axial distance Œ± was set to (2^k)^{1/4} = (2^2)^{1/4} = 1.414 to achieve rotatability. This property allows for unbiased optimization in all directions of the design space. These points allow the estimation of second-order effects. For a two-factor system, four axial runs are generated. This setup resulted in a **10-run CCD** per material configuration, where *k* is the number of continuous factors:

---

- 2 ^ k = 4 factorial points  
- 2 √ó k = 4 axial points  
- 5 center replicates  
- Total: **13 runs per categorical condition**

---

#### CCD Block Assignment

The remaining two parameters, both material-related, were categorical and tested at two levels:  

- **Blade Material**: *High-Speed Steel (HSS)*, *TiAlN-Coated Carbide*  
- **Tape Adhesion Type**: *Acrylic-Based Pressure-Sensitive Tape (PSA)*, *UV Dicing Tape*

These were treated as fixed blocks, and a full CCD was independently applied under each of the 4 possible categorical combinations, as shown below, resulting in 4 (blocks) √ó 13 (CCD runs) = 52 experiments required to complete the CCD across all blocks.

---

- (HSS, PSA)
- (HSS, UV)
- (TiAlN, PSA)
- (TiAlN, UV)

---

#### CCD Quadratic Fitting

The quadratic model fitted by CCD is expressed as:

$$
y = \beta_0 + \sum_i \beta_i x_i + \sum_i \beta_{ii} x_i^2 + \sum_{i < j} \beta_{ij} x_i x_j
$$

This model captures linear effects ($\beta_i x_i$), quadratic curvature ($\beta_{ii} x_i^2$), and pairwise interactions ($\beta_{ij} x_i x_j$) among the input variables. It enables accurate prediction of the response $y$ across the design space, allowing identification of optimal settings.

### Model Evaluation Stage

#### 1. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

ANOVA was used to assess the overall significance of the model and the contribution of each term. A low p-value (typically < 0.05) for the model indicates that the selected factors explain a significant portion of the variability in the response. Term-specific p-values help identify which main effects, interactions, or quadratic terms are statistically meaningful. The fitted model is statistically significant overall. Both main and quadratic effects are important, and interaction terms contribute meaningfully to the response variance.

---

#### ANOVA Result

- **Model F-statistic**: 18.42  
- **Model p-value**: < 0.001  
- **Significant terms**:  
  - Blade Speed (linear, p = 0.002)  
  - Cutting Force (quadratic, p = 0.004)  
  - Speed √ó Force (interaction, p = 0.012)

---

#### 2. Lack-of-Fit Test

The lack-of-fit test was used to determine whether the quadratic model adequately captures the observed response trends. A non-significant p-value (p > 0.05) suggests that the model fits the data well and no higher-order terms are needed. This ensures that the fitted surface is sufficient without overfitting. The non-significant p-value indicates that the model adequately fits the experimental data. There is no evidence of systematic deviation from the observed response, and no additional higher-order terms are needed.

---

#### Lack-of-Fit Test Result

- **Lack-of-fit p-value**: 0.382  
- **Pure error MS**: 0.006  
- **Lack-of-fit MS**: 0.008

---

#### 3. Canonical Analysis

Canonical analysis was performed to identify the geometric nature of the response surface. By analyzing the eigenvalues of the quadratic form, the model determines whether the surface is convex, concave, or saddle-shaped. The stationary point (extremum) is also computed to locate the optimal combination of input factors. This provides geometric justification for selecting the operating region. Canonical analysis was performed on the combined model including all four process blocks, with the block factor included as a fixed effect. The resulting stationary point reflects the global optimum of the pooled response surface, assuming consistent curvature across blocks. The response surface is convex with a well-defined global minimum. This supports the identification of an optimal operating point within the tested parameter space.

---

#### Canonical Analysis Result

- **Eigenvalues**: 1.74, 0.83 (both > 0)  
- **Stationary point**:  
  - Blade Speed = 3975 rpm  
  - Cutting Force = 24.7 N  
- **Nature of surface**: Convex (bowl-shaped)
